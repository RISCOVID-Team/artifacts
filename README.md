# RISCOVID 
This work presents a study for assessing the technology acceptance of a contact tracing app, also proposed by us, which is a hybrid crowdsensing application (opportunistic and participatory). The goal of the app is that users are notified if they were in contact with others infected. It also allows creating a heat map identifying streets, squares, and commercial locations to which contaminated users were, allowing more assertive hygiene actions and eliminating infectious disease outbreaks. Our methodology aimed on finding whether people would be willing to share their location, as well as their health issues related to COVID-19. It is composed by a survey for verifying the interest of the proposed application; the prototype of the application; and the use of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We can see that the vast majority of respondents to the first survey were interested in using a contact tracking application, even though they need to share their location and report when they become infected. In addition, the proposed RISCOVID application proved to be accepted for use by participants in the second survey.
